# SmartRockets
In this project, we see whether the given objects touch the target or not. We see them as generations. It simulates whether the generation is successful or not. The simulation was prepared in the Processing (Java) environment with p5.js library. This project is just a little changed version of the Daniel Shiffman's Smart Rockets.
